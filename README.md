# AirZome

AirZome is the first prototype of "Organic Home".
It's future-proof, extremely lightweight, modular, and transportable.

You'll find in this repository 2 .skp 3D files (Sketchup)
- `AIRZOME_8_480-version.skp` : 3D model of the very first prototype of AirZome (8 faces - 4.80 meters wide)
- `AIRZOME_8_480_BUILDING_PROCESS-version.skp` : this file helps you visualize the main building phases of AirZome's blocks

    You may use the free version of Sketchup to browse the files.

As an added bonus, you may find a .USDZ 3D scene of the AirZome to play with your iPhone with AR capabilities. Sorry for Android users, I didn't find the way yet to export the scene to the correct format.

Enjoy, get inspired. Maybe try builing it yourself? Enhance and share back to everyone.  
The world needs your singular touch.
